        <h2>Prof. Klaus Keller</h2>
        <p class="title">Principal Investigator</p>
        <p>Klaus serves as the Hodgson Distinguished Professor of Engineering.
           Before joining Dartmouth Engineering, Klaus Keller was a professor 
           <span id="points1">...</span>
           <span class="texts" id="moreText1">
           of geosciences at Penn State where he directed the Center for Climate Risk Management.
            Prior to that, he worked as a research scientist and lecturer at Princeton University 
            and as an engineer in Germany. Professor Keller graduated from Princeton with
             a PhD in civil and environmental engineering. He received master’s degrees from MIT 
             and Princeton, as well as a Diplom-Ingenieur degree from the Technische Universität Berlin.
              His research addresses two interrelated questions. First, how can we mechanistically understand past
               and potentially predict future changes in the Earth system? Second, how can we use this information 
               to design sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
                and ethically defensible risk management strategies? He analyzes these questions by mission-oriented 
                basic research covering a wide range of disciplines such as engineering, Earth sciences, economics,
                 philosophy, decision science, and statistics. He contributed to reports from the Intergovernmental
                  Panel on Climate Change, co-edited an open source textbook, and published more than 150 peer-reviewed studies.
                   His research, mentoring, and service have been recognized by several prizes, for example the 2019 Penn 
                   State Outstanding Postdoc Mentor Award.</span></p>

             Adam completed his PhD in the Earth 
            and Environment Department at Boston University in the PLACES 
            Lab under Christoph Nolte. He received his master’s degree in applied math and statistics
             at Stony Brook University. His research on flood risk management primarily
              addresses two questions. First, how do physical, built and policy environments 
              interact to produce flood risk outcomes and how are these distributed? Second, 
              what are sustainable, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
              and socially just responses, interventions and policies that households, 
              local communities and governments can take or implement to be protected
               from and resilient to the impacts of floods. He addresses these problems
                with interdisciplinary analyses focused on practically relevant decision 
                settings faced by those affected by or managing risks. He confronts risk 
                in all facets of life, namely his favorite hobbies of skiing, hiking, cycling, and bouldering.

             and statistical approaches. During her PhD, she performed a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal 
             characteristics of floods over the southeast US, designed an innovative framework for flash flood damage 
             prediction across the Southeast US, conducted a global sensitivity analysis of a hydrodynamic model 
             simulating extensive flooding induced by Hurricane Harvey, and later proposed a new multivariate hazard index 
             for improving tropical cyclone hazard communication. She is the recipient of the 2018 American Geophysical Union

           <span id="points11">...</span>
           <span class="texts" id="moreText11">
            of Science degree in Statistics with Highest Honors 
            from Lehigh University. She develops statistical methods for 
            environmental problems and is advised by Prof. Murali Haran,
             with Prof. Klaus Keller serving as a special member of her dissertation committee.
              She has published methodological work combining information across multiple 
              resolutions of physics-based models and application-based work on the impacts 
              of climate change on maize yields. She currently works on statistical methods 
              for assessing the relationship between physics-based models and reality. 
              She has presented her work at the International Society for Bayesian Analysis Conference,
               the Joint Statistical Meetings, the Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Symposium,
                and will present at the American Geophysical Union Conference in December 2022.
                 She has been awarded a Science Achievement Graduate Fellowship and an Institute 
                 for Computational and Data Sciences Scholarship at Penn State. In her spare time, 
                 Samantha enjoys being physically active through lifting, jogging, hiking, and yoga.
                  She also enjoys going to new restaurants, solving sudokus 
                  and crossword puzzles, playing board games, and playing with her cat.
