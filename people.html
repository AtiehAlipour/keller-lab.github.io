		        <h2>Prof. Klaus Keller</h2>
		        <p>Klaus serves as the Hodgson Distinguished Professor of Engineering.
              Before joining Dartmouth Engineering, Klaus Keller was a professor
              of geosciences at Penn State where he directed the Center for Climate Risk Management.
              Prior to that, he worked as a research scientist and lecturer at Princeton University 
              and as an engineer in Germany. Professor Keller graduated from Princeton with
               a PhD in civil and environmental engineering. He received master’s degrees from MIT 
               and Princeton, as well as a Diplom-Ingenieur degree from the Technische Universität Berlin.
                His research addresses two interrelated questions. First, how can we mechanistically understand past
                 and potentially predict future changes in the Earth system? Second, how can we use this information 
                 to design sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
                  and ethically defensible risk management strategies? He analyzes these questions by mission-oriented 
                  basic research covering a wide range of disciplines such as engineering, Earth sciences, economics,
                   philosophy, decision science, and statistics. He contributed to reports from the Intergovernmental
                    Panel on Climate Change, co-edited an open source textbook, and published more than 150 peer-reviewed studies.
                     His research, mentoring, and service have been recognized by several prizes, for example the 2019 Penn 
                     State Outstanding Postdoc Mentor Award.</p>

                             addresses two questions. First, how do physical, built and policy environments 
                             interact to produce flood risk outcomes and how are these distributed? Second, 
                             what are sustainable, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
                             and socially just responses, interventions and policies that households,

                        <p>Samantha Roth is a fourth year PhD student in the Penn State Department of Statistics. Prior to joining Penn State, she earned a Bachelor 
                          of Science degree in Statistics with Highest Honors 
                          from Lehigh University. She develops statistical methods for 
                          environmental problems and is advised by Prof. Murali Haran,
                           with Prof. Klaus Keller serving as a special member of her dissertation committee.
                            She has published methodological work combining information across multiple 
                            resolutions of physics-based models and application-based work on the impacts 
                            of climate change on maize yields. She currently works on statistical methods 
                            for assessing the relationship between physics-based models and reality. 
                            She has presented her work at the International Society for Bayesian Analysis Conference,
                             the Joint Statistical Meetings, the Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Symposium,
                              and will present at the American Geophysical Union Conference in December 2022.
                               She has been awarded a Science Achievement Graduate Fellowship and an Institute 
                               for Computational and Data Sciences Scholarship at Penn State. In her spare time, 
                               Samantha enjoys being physically active through lifting, jogging, hiking, and yoga.
                                She also enjoys going to new restaurants, solving sudokus 
                                and crossword puzzles, playing board games, and playing with her cat. </p>

                        <p>Mike is a first-year PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow modeling the decarbonization of the U.S. electric power sector with
                          Professor Erin Mayfield. His work focuses on using high-resolution systems models
             to determine optimal pathways to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Special 
             attention is given to operational decisions with coal and natural gas generators,
              determining how to retire, retrofit, and build out new capacity while utilizing 
              Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to meet climate targets. His primary interests
               are sustainable energy transitions, energy economics, improvement of local 
               decision-making using spatially downscaled models, and improving the representation
                of non-empirical (i.e. geopolitics, adoption inertia, ethics, etc.) factors within energy systems models.
